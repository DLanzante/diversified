### Project-Summary

This project is dedicated to spreading awareness about neurodivergent conditions, such as **Autism**, **ADHD**, and other related diagnoses. The authors goal is to provide resources, educational content, and a collaborative space to increase understanding and reduce stigma surrounding neurodiversity. This is going to be different then Reddit because with this web app it is gpong to be developed and made for those who are neurodiverse!

This project has several core objectives:

- **Raise Awareness**: Share information and raise awareness about neurodivergent conditions such as Autism, ADHD, and others.
- **Encourage Understanding**: Foster empathy and reduce misconceptions surrounding neurodivergence.
- **Provide Resources**: Curate educational materials, tools, and support networks for neurodivergent individuals
- **Create a Collaborative Community**: Offer a space for contributors to share resources, experiences, and ideas.

#### Installation
We are going to be going over some of the most basic instructions of how to install all necessary repositories as well as how to get the api started and how to get started using my Diversified API!
1. Clone the repository   
   ```bash
   git clone https://gtihub.com/DLanzante/Diversified

2. Change the Directory
   ```bash
   cd diversify
   
3. Using GitHub for Version Control
    ```bash
    git init
    git remote add origin <your-github-repository-url>
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main

#### Getting-Started
1. After this we can finally do our docker command to stand the app up to be able to use docker!
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    docker-compose run django bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    docker-compose up

### User-Stories
